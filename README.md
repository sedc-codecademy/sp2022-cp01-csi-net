## Crypto Simulator :dollar:

### Idea :sparkles:
Technology is constantly changing and evolving, and with that come new and exciting ways to implement it. An interesting trend is blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency market.\
For this reason, we decided to create a website that will provide all the features and functionalities that real websites for trading with cryptocurrencies provide.

This website is a perfect match for those who are willing to start trading with cryptocurrencies but are not ready to invest real money and yet want to see what investment would get them. Experienced traders are also welcome, as they can try different portfolio combinations and strategies for free. 

### Description and Features :page_facing_up:
The website is separated into multiple parts like the Home page, Statistics page, Crypto Simulator page and Info Center. Some of the pages are available to all visitors, and some pages are only available to those that will create an account.

On the Home Page, the user can see some of the trending data regarding cryptocurrencies, like the most popular crypto currencies according to the market size, price etc., and the best-selling cryptocurrencies. Here, the user can also find some interesting facts and statistics regarding trading with cryptos.

There is also a dedicated Statistics Page, where the user can check detailed statistics like rank, name, price, market cap, and price change in the last 24 hours and last 7 days. Here, data for the best and the worst-performing cryptocurrencies in the last 24 hours are provided. 

For the users that will register on our page, a crypto simulator page will be available. The crypto simulator supports all the features that real websites for trading with cryptocurrencies support. Here, the users will receive $100 000 virtual cash, so that they can fully trade (buy and sell coins) with different cryptos by current market prices and create their best winning strategy. The users will be able to see their profit/loss at any time. The profit or the loss will depend on the coins they own at the moment and the movement of the prices. Here, a custom user setting like tracking the userâ€™s activity, adding cash, limiting the cash and limiting the number of different currencies will be available, as well as additional statistics for the cryptos in the portfolio.

The Info Center page is of an informative and educational nature as it provides information on what is crypto currency, what blockchain is and how it works. It is highly recommended for those who are starting with crypto technology, but there are some interesting resources for experienced ones too.
